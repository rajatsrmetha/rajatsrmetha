Hi there, I'm Rajat! 👋
I'm an Avionics and Embedded Engineer with a passion for the full lifecycle of product development—from designing the ground support hardware all the way to deploying flight-critical firmware for mission-critical systems.

My core focus is on bridging the gap between hardware and software. I have hands-on experience developing for commercial space missions, including key contributions to the Dhruva Space LEAP-1 satellite. I specialize in creating reliable, memory-efficient code for resource-constrained environments and have a deep interest in custom bootloader design and robust OTA firmware updates.

🔭 I’m currently an Avionics Engineer II at Dhruva Space.
🌱 I’m skilled in Embedded C, FreeRTOS, and STM32 development.
💬 Ask me about firmware development, hardware debugging, or system integration.
